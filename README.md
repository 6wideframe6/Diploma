C++ realization of the dynamical equation of density operator in the case of classical field and quantum medium with two energy levels. 
The programm solves the equation with and without the rotating wave approximation and find the dependence of the error arising when 
applying the approximation on the frequency of the acting field at zero difference between the field frequency and the transition frequency.
Programm was made using OpenMP.
